## Goal
Replace split workflow command surfaces with a single `/workflows` command that opens a GUI picker.

## Target UX
- `/workflows` opens a scrollable list UI.
- First option is **Create workflow**.
- Remaining options are existing workflows.
- Selecting an existing workflow asks the model to use that workflow.

## Related items
- TODO 1720749b (nested AGENTS.md loading investigation) should be kept in sync if command/event wiring overlaps.

## Deliverable
Implement command consolidation, remove legacy `/workflow:*` dynamic commands, and provide verification notes showing GUI behavior and workflow injection behavior.
